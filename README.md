Guarded Command Language Compiler
====

This is one of my favorit study case of compiler development.
The language chosen is GCL which was defined by Dijkstra and you can find out more about it on wikipedia
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarded_Command_Language 

The compiler is written in Java, divided in Lexical analysis, syntactic analysis and semantical analysis.
The parses is based on look-a-head heuristic. Generates intermediate codes, and few assembly code.
